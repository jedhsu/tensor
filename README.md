## tensor

Tensor strengthens the type system the operator of numpy arrays.
* embeds tensors with a dependent type for their geometry. This can be later extended so a static checker can check that geometry of tensor operators is well-formed.
* provides type classes for all the 

Helpful because the file system structure helps infer the structure of the operators.
