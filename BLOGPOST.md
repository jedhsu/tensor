### topology

How do you represent an abstract element in a tensor?

i.e. how do you encapsulate the meaning here?

Consider a chess board.

Suppose that this chessboard is "infinite" in the sense that it is a plane. How would one encapsulate this meaning?

One would have to create an isomorphism for each point to a coordinate.

This is why set theory is failure to capture a topology. I am still only beginning to learn category theory, but this is why i am motivated to learn it.

This will fail the set-theoretic definition.

I am motivated to study category and type theory because I intuit that it is rigorously addressing this issue.

This is also a space with some structure.

A neighborhood is defined as any set of statements that evaluates to true.

Isomorphic to a topological space.

THE SET OF ALL TRUE STATEMENTS THEN FORMS A TOPOLOGY!

do not get confused here, it is not the notion of duality on the chessboard that is open. Consider three colors. Then what is open?

An open set is *statements that are true*, i.e. instances of that type.

Logical paradoxes are just diverging.
